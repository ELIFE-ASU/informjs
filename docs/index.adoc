Inform is a cross-platform C library designed for performing information analysis of complex
system.

1. The `inform_dist` struct provides discrete, emperical probability distributions. These
form the basis for all of the information-theoretic measures.

2. A collection of information measures built upon the distribution struct provide the core
algorithms for the library, and are provided through the `shannon.h` header.

3. A host of measures of the information dynamics on time series are built upon the core
information measures. Each measure is housed in its own header, e.g.  `active_info.h`.

In addition to the core components, a small collection of utilities are also
provided.
